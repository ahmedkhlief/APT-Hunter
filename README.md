# How to Use APT-Hunter

The first thing to do is to collect the logs if you didn’t and with powershell log collectors its easy to collect the needed logs automatically you just run the powershell scripts as administrator .

To collect the logs in EVTX format use :
windows-log-collector-full-v3-EVTX.ps1

To collect the logs in CSV format use :
windows-log-collector-full-v3-CSV.ps1

APT-Hunter built using python3 so in order to use the tool you need to install the required libraries ( **python3.9 is not supported yet**).

`python3 -m pip install -r Requirements.txt`

APT-Hunter is easy to use you just use the argument -h to print help to see the options needed .

` python3 APT-Hunter.py -h`

`usage: APT-Hunter.py [-h] [-p PATH] [-o OUT] [-t {csv,evtx}]`


`  -h, --help            show this help message and exit`

`  -p PATH, --path PATH  path to folder containing windows event logs generated by the APT-Hunter-Log-Collector.ps1`

`  -o OUT, --out OUT     output file name`

`  -t {csv,evtx}, --type {csv,evtx} csv ( logs from get-eventlog or windows event log GUI or logs from Get-WinEvent ) , evtx ( EVTX extension windows event log )`

`  --security SECURITY   Path to Security Logs`

`  --system SYSTEM       Path to System Logs`

`  --scheduledtask SCHEDULEDTASK  Path to Scheduled Tasks Logs`

`python3 APT-Hunter.py  -t csv  -p /opt/wineventlogs/  -o Project1`

`python3 APT-Hunter.py  -t evtx  --security evtx/security.evtx --powershell evtx/powershell.evtx -o Project2`

# The result will be available in two sheets :

Project1_Report.xlsx : this excel sheet will include all the events detected from every windows logs provided to APT-Hunter
